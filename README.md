* I thought about this project as there were times that I don't have any income.
* Because of my restrictions, I just find a way to hustle everyday for money.
* So here comes the internet for the rescue. It pointed me to sites where I can earn a hotmeal after using a mouse or tapping a mobile screen.
* As there are many websites out there that do this, some can be hard to deal with (meaning always screened out, takes too long to make a cash out), I decided to make a list of those sites I personally tried and tested.

# A User's Story

* There's a time that a sanction affected my work and I need to abandon my job. I need to  start somewhere in a new world that I am not familiar with. With no friends to turn to and family's very far away, I decided to look for something in the virtual world.

* At first, it is a challenge and like in the real world, there are plenty of sites that just waste your time and want to get your money. Luckily I do not have what they want and left me alone. 

* I came across website testing, mystery shopping and academic research, all online. Now I can afford a KFC meal. I know it is not much, but for me with my feet and hands tied to afford this is something.

# Design Choices

This site is geared to those people looking for a legitimate way to get something from their browsing experience. So links to legitimate, tested and real money making sites without cash outlay are in this site. 

So simple design is in mind. An introduction to what MoneyTree is all about, it's aim, what it can do to the user and simple links that transport the user to the legitimate sites.

A signup page for news letters that is set for at least every forthnight is also provided.
